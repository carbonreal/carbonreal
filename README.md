## About Us

Carbon Real is committed to fostering a net-zero, resilient, and natural future. While reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential, we believe it's equally important to promote conservation projects and protect irreplaceable carbon sinks. Our approach integrates advanced technologies for real-time monitoring of threatened natural areas, collaborating closely with local communities to ensure their long-term protection and sustainability.

## What We Offer

We provide forest and woodland owners, whose lands are vulnerable to anthropogenic and natural threats, the opportunity to monetize the ecosystem service of CO₂ removal occurring naturally on their properties. Our projects generate high-quality carbon credits based on real measurements and traceable data, aiming to:

- **Conserve and regenerate nature**
- **Create sustainable economic benefits for local communities and landowners**

## Our Objectives

1. **Maximize Benefits for Landowners**: Ensure forest and jungle owners receive the highest benefit for their conservation efforts.
2. **Reliable Information**: Utilize technology that guarantees 100% reliability of the data underpinning our carbon credits.
3. **Community and Ecosystem Impact**: Ensure our projects have measurable direct impacts on surrounding communities and ecosystems, committing a percentage of income for this purpose from the outset.
4. **High Standards of Governance**: Implement the highest standards of governance in resource management.

## Our Approach

- **State-of-the-Art Technology**: Employ advanced technologies to measure environmental variables with high precision.
- **Ensuring Traceability**: Maintain transparent and traceable processes throughout our projects.
- **Data-Driven Methods**: Utilize non-predictive methods based on real and verifiable data.
- **High ESG Standards**: Uphold high Environmental, Social, and Governance standards.
- **Community Involvement**: Engage local communities and other entities in our mission through a robust governance system.

## What Makes Us Different

**Quality** for Carbon Real encompasses technology, biodiversity, and community engagement:

### Technology

We are at the forefront of environmental measurement technologies, applying the most suitable, detailed, and accurate tools in each phase:

- **Scanning**: Advanced scanning technology using light pulses to create detailed and accurate maps of natural environments, allowing biomass quantification with centimeter accuracy.
- **Flow Measurement**: Systems capable of recording CO₂ variations over time. When the net ecosystem exchange reaches 1 ton of CO₂ removed, a tradable carbon credit is generated online autonomously, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Tokenization**: Implementation of blockchain technology, enabling users to audit project information at any time, ensuring traceability of scientific, administrative, and legal data.

### Biodiversity

By focusing on conserving existing forests and jungles, we not only safeguard their CO₂ removal services but also protect their ecosystems and biodiversity. Our field and laboratory work provides ecological metrics to study various biodiversity components (flora, fauna, fungi, etc.), integrating this data into our quality standards.

### Community Engagement

We view local communities as true partners, involving them in decision-making and sharing in the prosperity generated by our projects. Through governance and economic development plans, we aim to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainability of our initiatives.
